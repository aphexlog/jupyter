## Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone
```

1. initialize & activate your python virtual environment (optional)

```bash
python3 -m virtualenv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
```

1. Install the requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the jupyter notebook server

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

OR do what I do and use the [Jupyter VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) to run the notebook in VSCode. It's pretty slick.
